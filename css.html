            <h2>WHAT IS CSS?</h2>
            <p>
                Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets. <em>Is that really enough?</em></p>
                <p>
                    Well, this is a special or unique markup language that is used in web development
                     in combination with hypertext markup language to style and design the presentation 
                     of a web page or many of them. There are mainly three types of css, namely;
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Internal css: This works mainly within the particular web page to be styled.
                         It is used to style the different components of the web page within the 
                         same web page.</li>
                    <li>Inline css: This works like the internal css, but the difference is that 
                        for the inline css, we style a particular element at a go but not all the related
                         elements within the web page. Simply we style an element using its corresponding
                          attributes.</li>
                    <li>External css: An external css is a separate and independent css file that is used
                         to style the presentation and appearance of a web page as well as different same
                          web pages to be styled in the same format. This external css file though, can be 
                          accessed by creating a link to it in the web page to be styled.</li>
                </ol>

            </h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Internal css: This is used in the head tag<br>
                   
                </li>
                <li>Inline css: This used as an attribute of an element.<br>
                
                </li>
                <li>External css: This is used in a different css file created and linked from the page to be styled.<br>
                
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>CSS SELECTORS.</h2>
            <p>
                These are used in css to identify a particular element to be styled. They include the following;
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
                <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
            </ol>
