            <h2>WHY I JOINED BUGEMA UNIVERSITY</h2>
            <p>
                Firstly, i chose to join Bugema University because i had known about it ever since i was 
                baptised to enter the Seventh Day Adventist church. I always had a passion to join any 
                Seventh Day Adventist institution of learning because of the christian foundation that 
                they put in every single student. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, i chose to join Bugema University because it has the coourse that i always wanted
                 and desired to study. Fortunately i got a cahnce to join the University on a sports bursary
                  helped me persue my course for free of tuition charge.
